DevilDesign PET-G filament provides good results up to 60 mm/s at 0.2 mm
layer or up to 40 mm/s on 0.3 mm layer.

Other settings (Prusa PET-G and DevilDesign PLA) are practically unuseable.

Never leave it printing unmonitored unless you develop a 
filament flow sensor from small optical mouse which must
stop printing after filament stops flowing.
